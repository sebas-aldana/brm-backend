# BRM Backend API

Welcome to the BRM Backend API documentation. This API provides endpoints for managing products, purchases, and user authentication.

## Authentication

Most endpoints require authentication. Include the JWT token in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```
